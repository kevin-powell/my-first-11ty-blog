# JAMStack personal blog - starter files

These are the starting files used by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.co) to create a personal blog site for the [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/) DevProjects Challenge, [Create a fast and secure blog using JAMStack](#). You are free to use them however you want to get started with the challenge, if you'd like to start working on creating the site without worrying about the content itself.

The `design-files` folder contains both a Figma file, and .jpg of a design. You do not need to use this design. Kevin used this design in his tutorial, and they are provided if you would rather focus on creating something without worrying about design decisions.

The `src` folder contains files so that you can get your project up and running without worrying about content for posts/articles. That folder contains:

- 5 blog articles in the `blog` folder
- images and a logo in the `assets` folder

The articles are written in Markdown, and include Front Matter. Depending on the Static Site Generator you use, it is possible that you will have to modify these a little if you wish to use them. 

## DevProjects Challenge

As mentioned, these files are here to help get started with a DevProjects challenge. Please visit the [challenge page](#) to learn more about the challenge.

## Tutorial

You can [watch this video](#) to see how Kevin uses Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.
